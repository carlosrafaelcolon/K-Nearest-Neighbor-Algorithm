# Plinko - K-Nearest Neighbor (knn) Algorithm

Objective is to predict which bucket a ball will fall into by implementing a KNN algorithm. Please view the **score.js** file to see the relevant code.

> Birds of a feather flock together

## Key Parts

- Test and Training Data
- Accuracy Reporting
- Multi-Dimensional KNN (Ball drop, bounciness, & size)
- Feature Normalization
- Evaluating different feature values
